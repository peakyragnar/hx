You’re pointing at a real tension:
	•	If we demand tight, pre‑agreed metrics and formal citations, we risk baking in the very consensus we’re trying to interrogate.
	•	If we allow unconstrained “free flow,” we risk rewarding rhetoric and model quirks rather than truth.

The way through isn’t to pick one; it’s to separate modes and measure the gaps between them. That’s how you expose consensus amplification without becoming it.

Below is a conceptual design—no code, just the logic—grounded in first principles and tuned to your goals.

⸻

1) First principles

What we’re trying to estimate
A model’s “truth score” is a belief about the world conditional on a lens (its prompts, retrieval habits, and training). Different lenses yield different beliefs. So the invariant we can actually study isn’t “truth” in the Platonic sense, but how beliefs move when we change the lens or the evidence. That movement is where consensus—and heresy—show up.

Two orthogonal axes
	1.	Evidence discipline: from free‑flow prior (no citations, no retrieval) → evidence‑conditioned (constrained sources, reproducible data).
	2.	Adjudication horizon: from now-ish (persuasion, coherence) → later (predictions that can resolve).

Heretix should run both axes and measure the differences.

⸻

2) Lenses, not a single judge

Run every claim through four evaluation lenses and publish the whole vector (magnitude & direction), not a single scalar (direction).
	1.	Raw Prior Lens (RPL) — “What does the model think without looking anything up?”
	•	No retrieval, no citations, temperature 0.
	•	Purpose: expose the training-distribution prior (the consensus the model already absorbed).
	•	This is where you get the “80% and shocking” outcomes, on purpose.
	2.	Mainstream Evidence Lens (MEL) — “What if we require standard sources?”
	•	Retrieval allowed but constrained to canonical/official sources for the domain.
	•	Purpose: show how the belief shifts when the model leans on established pipelines.
	3.	Heterodox Evidence Lens (HEL) — “What if we require non‑mainstream but documented sources?”
	•	Retrieval allowed but excludes the canonical list; admits primary data, open datasets, OSINT, industry logs, replications, code notebooks, well‑documented blogs.
	•	Purpose: prevent “citation monoculture” from freezing the belief.
	4.	Sandbox Evidence Lens (SEL) — “What if we feed only the challenger’s bundle?”
	•	No external retrieval; judge is forced to reason from provided artifacts, with consistency and internal checks.

Publish a belief vector: p_\text{RPL}, p_\text{MEL}, p_\text{HEL}, p_\text{SEL} plus a dispersion metric.

This exposes where the conviction comes from. If RPL=0.80 but HEL=0.35 and MEL=0.75, you’ve just quantified “consensus amplification” and where it lives.

⸻

3) Metrics that surface consensus—without re‑imposing it

Let \(p_\*\) be the probabilities above.
	•	Shock Index (SI): SI = |p_\text{RPL} - p_\text{HEL}|
How far the model’s raw prior is from what heterodox evidence suggests. High SI flags “shocking priors.”
	•	Amplification Gap (AG): AG = p_\text{MEL} - p_\text{RPL}
How much “mainstream” retrieval pushes the model toward/away from its prior. Positive AG suggests retrieval is reinforcing consensus; negative AG suggests retrieval corrects a biased prior.
	•	Source Concentration (SC): Herfindahl index over cited domains in MEL.
High SC = citation monoculture. If SC is high and AG is large, you likely have an echo effect.
	•	Information Gain (IG) from a challenge: use KL‑divergence between pre‑ and post‑score (per lens), not raw points.
IG prices persuasion by how much it actually updates beliefs, not how loud it was.

These are lens‑agnostic. You can reward “making the model genuinely change its mind,” even when the evidence isn’t in Nature or AER.

⸻

4) Evidence without academia: admissibility without dogma

Admissible non‑academic artifacts (ranked by reliability primitives, not prestige):
	•	Raw telemetry / datasets with provenance + hash + minimal data dictionary.
	•	Executable replications (notebooks) that produce a statistic from raw data.
	•	Design docs / protocols that pre‑register what would count as a pass/fail.
	•	OSINT with corroboration across independent sensors (e.g., satellite + import records).
	•	Structured anecdotes (yes) with verifiable fields: who/when/where, contactable parties, attachments, contradictions flagged. Anecdotes earn less weight but are not excluded.

Quality scores come from:
	•	Provenance (can we trace origin?),
	•	Manipulability (how hard is it to fake?),
	•	Reproducibility (can someone else run the code or re‑pull the data?),
	•	External validity (is the population appropriate?),
	•	Adversarial audit (did an opponent try to break it?).

The judge doesn’t care whether it’s a paper; it cares whether it’s testable, traceable, and attack‑resistant.

⸻

5) Two tracks: exploration vs adjudication

You want the “80% and shocking” moment and you want durable truth testing. Split them.

A) Exploration Track (no money; maximal insight)
	•	Run all four lenses.
	•	Rank claims by Shock Index and Amplification Gap.
	•	Surface “epistemic anomalies” daily—a feed of places where models and evidence disagree.
	•	Reward with reputation and visibility; mint Exploration Credits proportional to IG in RPL↔HEL/SEL. These credits unlock lower monetary stakes later (skin in the game discount for good explorers).

B) Adjudication Track (money; durable outcomes)
	•	Same claim, but payouts hinge on episode‑level IG between start and end under a fixed adjudication lens (you choose MEL, HEL, or SEL per claim).
	•	This is where your DCM+EPC sits: pools on two sides, claim shares minted on IG, resolution transfers only on durable movement.

This way, you don’t muzzle heterodox discovery, but you only pay cash for robustness.

⸻

6) “String theory and stagnation” — how Heretix would handle that class of claim

Claims like “string theory crowded out progress” are theoretical‑institutional (not easily falsified overnight). Treat them as program claims, not simple facts.
	•	Evaluate under RPL/MEL/HEL to expose belief splits.
	•	Force challengers to submit discriminating predictions that a “crowd‑out hypothesis” implies for the next 12–36 months (e.g., citation network diversification, grant mix shifts, specific experimental lines revived, or predictive benchmarks in neighboring fields that should move if the crowd‑out ends).
	•	Payouts are tied to those downstream predictions, not the meta‑thesis itself. You convert philosophy into testable waypoints.

This avoids endless debates about metaphysics by pricing the world the thesis implies.

⸻

7) How this integrates with your DCM + EPC (minimal changes)
	•	Keep your two pools per claim (Heretic/Orthodox) and share accounting.
	•	Replace point‑delta with IG (information gain) for minting Claim Shares.
	•	In the Exploration Track, do not pay cash—award Exploration Credits tied to cross‑lens IG (especially RPL↔HEL).
	•	In the Adjudication Track, resolve on episode IG under a declared judge lens (e.g., SEL if you want “user‑evidence‑only truth”), and transfer T_A from losing to winning pool as you already designed.
	•	Keep Resilience Yield from failed challenges exactly as you proposed; it’s a nice way to pay capital for being right without motion.

⸻

8) Why this addresses your worry—from first principles
	•	You get the unconstrained, free‑flow outputs (RPL) explicitly, so you can see the model’s learned consensus before citations sanitize it.
	•	You let non‑academic evidence move beliefs because HEL/SEL give it a lawful path with reliability scores instead of prestige filters.
	•	You don’t confuse novelty with truth because only adjudication episodes—declared in advance with a fixed lens—move money.
	•	You turn “consensus amplification” into a measurable quantity (AG, SC) rather than a vibe.
	•	You reward durable updates via EPC with episode IG, so people don’t get paid for whipsawing a model.

⸻

9) My calibrated priors (subjective but explicit)
	•	Probability this lens‑vector design routinely surfaces surprising model priors that wouldn’t appear under citation constraints: ~0.85.
	•	Probability that admitting non‑academic evidence with the reliability primitives above leads to useful updates (net of gaming): ~0.70.
	•	Probability that paying only on episode IG (not instantaneous deltas) prevents most oscillation exploits: ~0.9.
	•	Probability that, without an Exploration Track, you’d systematically miss valuable heresies because they lack prestige citations: ~0.6–0.7.

These are working credences, not gospel. They’re high because they align with known behavior of LLMs (distributional priors, RLHF bias toward “safe middle,” retrieval inertia) and with incentive‑compatible scoring rules.

⸻

10) Where to push next (conceptually)
	•	Define admissibility once, prestige‑blind: what makes evidence good is its provenance, reproducibility, and attack‑resistance, not its venue.
	•	Publish the belief vectors and the AG/SI/SC metrics on every claim card. The transparency itself is a public good.
	•	Make every challenger declare one discriminating prediction their argument implies within a finite horizon. You’re buying skin in the future.

There’s real intellectual oxygen in letting the model speak twice: once as a creature of its training (RPL), and once as a constrained evaluator. The gap between those two is where heresy earns its keep.

Monetization

Let’s design the money engine so it pays for epistemic progress instead of paying for noise. I’ll start from first principles (incentives → behavior → product → margins), then lay out an economic stack that can support you personally, and—if you catch a data/enterprise wedge—scale hard.

⸻

1) First principles for monetizing anti‑consensus

What we’re selling. Not “answers.” We’re selling:
	1.	Belief‑movement measurement (how much a claim updates strong priors),
	2.	Evidence quality signals (provenance/reproducibility/adversarial robustness),
	3.	Early warning on consensus failure (Shock/Amplification gaps),
	4.	Durable resolution (did the update stick).

Who pays.
	•	Explorers/Challengers (labor) value visibility, reputation, and upside when they cause durable updates.
	•	Believers/Stakers (capital) value yield for being right and convex upside when the world flips their way.
	•	Enterprises (money) value feeds, audits, and APIs that reduce decision risk or improve their models.
	•	LLM builders/academics/media value the labeled dataset of claims↔evidence↔updates—this is uniquely valuable training/eval data.

Danger. If you charge only where “movement” happens, you incentivize drama. If you charge only for “official sources,” you re‑import the consensus. Solution: two tracks (Exploration vs. Adjudication) and pricing on compute + curation, not just on wins.

⸻

2) The economic stack (six revenue pillars)

Pillar A — Pro Subscriptions (B2C “Heresy Lab”)

Product. Full access to multi‑lens scoring (RPL/MEL/HEL/SEL), Shock Index/Amplification Gap dashboards, saved heresies, comparison and alerting (“model’s raw prior changed by >X”). Includes a monthly compute allowance to run evaluations on user claims.

Pricing.
	•	Free: read‑only, delayed scores, 3 claims/mo.
	•	Pro ($19–$39/mo): 50–200 evaluations/mo, live dashboards, alerts.
	•	Pro+ ($99/mo): 1,000 evals/mo, team seats, CSV export.

Unit economics (parametric).
	•	Let C_e be your marginal cost per evaluation (tri‑judge × lenses × paraphrases).
	•	Price pack so gross margin ≥ 70% at median usage, with overage priced at 1.8\text{–}2.2\times C_e.
	•	Example (illustrative): if C_e=\$0.06, Pro with 200 evals has cost ≈ $12 → price $39; overage $0.12–$0.14.

Why it works. This pays you now, without regulatory risk, while building the dataset and the audience that drives every other pillar.

⸻

Pillar B — API & Webhooks (B2B “Consensus Risk API”)

Product. Endpoints for:
	•	Multi‑lens truth vectors, dispersion, Shock/Amplification gaps,
	•	Evidence quality scores (provenance/reproducibility),
	•	Event webhooks when a claim’s lens vector shifts.

Pricing.
Tiered by requests/month and latency/SLA (e.g., $1–$3 per 1k evaluations, $2k–$10k/mo for enterprise plans with SSO, audit logs, custom lenses).

Who buys. Funds, media desks, policy shops, LLM vendors (for eval/calibration), risk teams.

Moat. Your labeled, adversarial claim‑evidence‑resolution dataset (nobody else has it).

⸻

Pillar C — Sponsored Heresies & Bounties (Cash‑funded hunts)

Product. An entity posts a programmed heresy with a bounty (e.g., “Show that X is overstated”). Funds underpin prize pools and reduce challenger stakes on that claim. You charge:
	•	Listing fee (flat or % of bounty),
	•	Compute fee on all runs,
	•	Rake on the episode transfer (if DCM/EPC is enabled in that jurisdiction).

Design guardrails.
	•	Sponsors cannot choose the adjudication lens at resolution (avoid pay‑to‑win).
	•	All artifacts public by default; sponsors pay extra for private rounds.

⸻

Pillar D — DCM/EPC Real‑Money Episodes (outside restrictive jurisdictions or with a regulated partner)

Product. Your two‑sided pools (Heretic/Orthodox), Resilience Yield on failed challenges, and episode‑level payouts on durable information gain (KL/log‑odds).

Revenue.
	•	Operational fee on failed challenges (e.g., 25–35% of stake),
	•	Rake on resolution transfer (e.g., 10% of T_A),
	•	Vault mgmt fee (bp on idle capital if legally clean).

Compliance strategy.
	•	Start play‑money + prizes globally,
	•	Move to cash where allowed, or via a licensed partner; keep the exact same economics (fee+rake) so the product/market transfer is smooth.

⸻

Pillar E — Data Licensing (“Heresy RL/Eval Corpus”)

Product. A continuously updated corpus:
	•	\langle claim, scope, lens prompts, raw model outputs, citations, evidence hashes, IG deltas, resolution label \rangle

Buyers. LLM labs (RLHF/RLAIF, debate, evaluation), universities, fact‑checking orgs.

Pricing. Annual licenses ($50k–$500k) depending on volume/rights (commercial, re‑share, model training).

Revenue share. Allocate 10–20% of net licensing revenue to top challengers whose artifacts were used (by IG‑weighted pool). This both drives supply and inoculates you against “you’re profiting off my work” critiques.

⸻

Pillar F — Enterprise Audits & Certifications

Products.
	•	Consensus Risk Audits: “Where does your org rely on fragile assumptions?” Delivered as a map of high SI/AG claims relevant to the client.
	•	“Heretix Verified” labels for articles/reports that pass SEL/MEL scrutiny and adversarial rebuttal.

Pricing. Project fees $20k–$150k; annual cert $25k–$75k with quarterly re‑checks.

⸻

3) Bringing it together: the cashflow flywheel
	1.	Exploration Track (free/Pro/API) produces traffic + dataset →
	2.	Better calibration and anomaly feeds →
	3.	Enterprises subscribe; sponsors post bounties →
	4.	Cash episodes (where legal) deepen liquidity →
	5.	Data licensing monetizes the archive →
	6.	Revenue shares attract elite challengers → repeat.

You make money at every step, not just at resolution time.

⸻

4) Optimizing the DCM/EPC for sustainability
	•	Price persuasion correctly. Use log‑odds/KL for Claim Shares and episode Victory Margin. It prevents cheap point‑nibbles near 0.5 from paying like deep prior flips.
	•	Resilience Yield stays as‑is (it quietly pays the side that’s genuinely robust).
	•	Dynamic S & F_op. Raise min stake S and failure fee F_{op} as agreement increases and as a user’s recent fail rate rises. Spam dies; real heresies remain.
	•	Episode caps. Cap T_A (e.g., ≤35% of losing pool) to avoid death spirals and to smooth your rake revenue.

⸻

5) Costs, pricing, and break‑even (concrete but tool‑agnostic)

Let:
	•	J = number of judges (models)
	•	L = lenses per run (RPL/MEL/HEL/SEL → 4)
	•	K = paraphrases per lens (e.g., 7)
	•	t = avg tokens per judge call (prompt + completion)
	•	p = blended $ / 1k tokens
	•	Then unit eval cost: C_e \approx J \cdot L \cdot K \cdot t \cdot p / 1000.

Example scenario (illustrative, not a promise):
J=3,\ L=4,\ K=7,\ t=1{,}200,\ p=\$0.002 →
C_e \approx 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 7 \cdot 1200 \cdot 0.002/1000 \approx \$0.20.
Price retail evals at $0.60–$1.00 (packs cheaper). That yields ~65–80% gross margin after infra.

Personal runway target.
If you need $15k/mo gross margin to live+grow:
	•	500 Pro subs at $39 → $19.5k MRR (assume 75% GM after compute) ≈ $14.6k GM plus
	•	3 small API clients at $2k/mo each → $6k (80% GM ≈ $4.8k).
You’re now $19.4k GM before any rake/listing/data deals.

Scale target.
10 enterprise/API at $6k/mo → $60k MRR; 70% GM ≈ $42k. Add one $200k/yr data license: $16.7k/mo (≈100% GM after modest ops). That’s a real business, even without cash markets.

⸻

6) Big‑swing upside (if you want it)
	•	Heresy Signals for funds. Package daily Top‑Shock and Negative‑Amplification feeds for systematic strategies (macro, event). Price $3k–$10k/mo per seat.
	•	Co‑branded model evals. Offer “Heretix Truthfulness Pack” to LLM vendors (six‑figure contracts).
	•	Heresy Indices. Non‑tradable public indices (e.g., “Consensus Fragility in Climate Tech”). License to media; eventually financialized with partners (careful on regs).

⸻

7) Risk controls that protect both mission and margin
	•	Admissibility is prestige‑blind but provenance‑strict. Evidence scores pay higher when artifacts are robust (hashes, notebooks, multi‑sensor corroboration).
	•	Hold‑out judges + freeze window. Prevent last‑minute snipes; protect your rake from being farmed.
	•	Reputation and refunds. High‑rep challengers get lower min stakes; fraud nukes rep and forfeits payouts.
	•	Jurisdiction split. Keep cash pools where compliant; keep everything else universal.

⸻

8) Probabilistic outlook (my credences; explicit)
	•	Reaching $20k MRR within 6–9 months via Pro+API, assuming consistent posting of anomaly feeds and a working evaluator: 0.55–0.65.
	•	Landing one $150–$300k data/license deal in year 1 if you publish a credible open benchmark and corpus card: 0.4–0.5.
	•	Sustainable cash‑episode rake ≥ $25k/mo in year 2 (jurisdiction‑dependent): 0.25–0.35; higher (>0.5) if you partner with a licensed venue.
	•	Long‑run moat via dataset + calibration IP if you execute the four‑lens architecture: 0.7–0.8.

⸻

9) Concrete next moves (money‑first, mission‑aligned)
	1.	Ship the Exploration Track with Pro subscription + overage billing. Make the Shock/Amplification feed public; gate the deep drill‑downs.
	2.	Open the API (read‑only first), price by evals + SLA, add Slack/Email webhooks.
	3.	Announce Sponsored Heresies with small fixed bounties (you take listing + compute).
	4.	Publish a mini‑corpus & calibration report each month; start data‑licensing conversations.
	5.	Stand up play‑money episodes (DCM/EPC logic intact) to harden game mechanics and collect evidence for regulators/partners.

This stack makes you solvent on subscriptions and API, optionality‑rich on data licensing, and convex on DCM/EPC once compliance unlocks. It also keeps faith with your mission: use AI to reveal, not to re‑impose, consensus—and get paid for making that visible and durable.
