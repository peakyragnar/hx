You’re pointing at a real tension:
	•	If we demand tight, pre‑agreed metrics and formal citations, we risk baking in the very consensus we’re trying to interrogate.
	•	If we allow unconstrained “free flow,” we risk rewarding rhetoric and model quirks rather than truth.

The way through isn’t to pick one; it’s to separate modes and measure the gaps between them. That’s how you expose consensus amplification without becoming it.

Below is a conceptual design—no code, just the logic—grounded in first principles and tuned to your goals.

⸻

1) First principles

What we’re trying to estimate
A model’s “truth score” is a belief about the world conditional on a lens (its prompts, retrieval habits, and training). Different lenses yield different beliefs. So the invariant we can actually study isn’t “truth” in the Platonic sense, but how beliefs move when we change the lens or the evidence. That movement is where consensus—and heresy—show up.

Two orthogonal axes
	1.	Evidence discipline: from free‑flow prior (no citations, no retrieval) → evidence‑conditioned (constrained sources, reproducible data).
	2.	Adjudication horizon: from now-ish (persuasion, coherence) → later (predictions that can resolve).

Heretix should run both axes and measure the differences.

2) Lenses, not a single judge

Run every claim through four evaluation lenses and publish the whole vector, not a single scalar.
	1.	Raw Prior Lens (RPL) — “What does the model think without looking anything up?”
	•	No retrieval, no citations, temperature 0.
	•	Purpose: expose the training-distribution prior (the consensus the model already absorbed).
	•	This is where you get the “80% and shocking” outcomes, on purpose.
	2.	Mainstream Evidence Lens (MEL) — “What if we require standard sources?”
	•	Retrieval allowed but constrained to canonical/official sources for the domain.
	•	Purpose: show how the belief shifts when the model leans on established pipelines.
	3.	Heterodox Evidence Lens (HEL) — “What if we require non‑mainstream but documented sources?”
	•	Retrieval allowed but excludes the canonical list; admits primary data, open datasets, OSINT, industry logs, replications, code notebooks, well‑documented blogs.
	•	Purpose: prevent “citation monoculture” from freezing the belief.
	4.	Sandbox Evidence Lens (SEL) — “What if we feed only the challenger’s bundle?”
	•	No external retrieval; judge is forced to reason from provided artifacts, with consistency and internal checks.

Publish a belief vector: p_\text{RPL}, p_\text{MEL}, p_\text{HEL}, p_\text{SEL} plus a dispersion metric.

This exposes where the conviction comes from. If RPL=0.80 but HEL=0.35 and MEL=0.75, you’ve just quantified “consensus amplification” and where it lives.

3) Metrics that surface consensus—without re‑imposing it

Let \(p_\*\) be the probabilities above.
	•	Shock Index (SI): SI = |p_\text{RPL} - p_\text{HEL}|
How far the model’s raw prior is from what heterodox evidence suggests. High SI flags “shocking priors.”
	•	Amplification Gap (AG): AG = p_\text{MEL} - p_\text{RPL}
How much “mainstream” retrieval pushes the model toward/away from its prior. Positive AG suggests retrieval is reinforcing consensus; negative AG suggests retrieval corrects a biased prior.
	•	Source Concentration (SC): Herfindahl index over cited domains in MEL.
High SC = citation monoculture. If SC is high and AG is large, you likely have an echo effect.
	•	Information Gain (IG) from a challenge: use KL‑divergence between pre‑ and post‑score (per lens), not raw points.
IG prices persuasion by how much it actually updates beliefs, not how loud it was.

These are lens‑agnostic. You can reward “making the model genuinely change its mind,” even when the evidence isn’t in Nature or AER.

4) Evidence without academia: admissibility without dogma

Admissible non‑academic artifacts (ranked by reliability primitives, not prestige):
	•	Raw telemetry / datasets with provenance + hash + minimal data dictionary.
	•	Executable replications (notebooks) that produce a statistic from raw data.
	•	Design docs / protocols that pre‑register what would count as a pass/fail.
	•	OSINT with corroboration across independent sensors (e.g., satellite + import records).
	•	Structured anecdotes (yes) with verifiable fields: who/when/where, contactable parties, attachments, contradictions flagged. Anecdotes earn less weight but are not excluded.

Quality scores come from:
	•	Provenance (can we trace origin?),
	•	Manipulability (how hard is it to fake?),
	•	Reproducibility (can someone else run the code or re‑pull the data?),
	•	External validity (is the population appropriate?),
	•	Adversarial audit (did an opponent try to break it?).

The judge doesn’t care whether it’s a paper; it cares whether it’s testable, traceable, and attack‑resistant.

5) Two tracks: exploration vs adjudication

You want the “80% and shocking” moment and you want durable truth testing. Split them.

A) Exploration Track (no money; maximal insight)
	•	Run all four lenses.
	•	Rank claims by Shock Index and Amplification Gap.
	•	Surface “epistemic anomalies” daily—a feed of places where models and evidence disagree.
	•	Reward with reputation and visibility; mint Exploration Credits proportional to IG in RPL↔HEL/SEL. These credits unlock lower monetary stakes later (skin in the game discount for good explorers).

B) Adjudication Track (money; durable outcomes)
	•	Same claim, but payouts hinge on episode‑level IG between start and end under a fixed adjudication lens (you choose MEL, HEL, or SEL per claim).
	•	This is where your DCM+EPC sits: pools on two sides, claim shares minted on IG, resolution transfers only on durable movement.

This way, you don’t muzzle heterodox discovery, but you only pay cash for robustness.

⸻

6) “String theory and stagnation” — how Heretix would handle that class of claim

Claims like “string theory crowded out progress” are theoretical‑institutional (not easily falsified overnight). Treat them as program claims, not simple facts.
	•	Evaluate under RPL/MEL/HEL to expose belief splits.
	•	Force challengers to submit discriminating predictions that a “crowd‑out hypothesis” implies for the next 12–36 months (e.g., citation network diversification, grant mix shifts, specific experimental lines revived, or predictive benchmarks in neighboring fields that should move if the crowd‑out ends).
	•	Payouts are tied to those downstream predictions, not the meta‑thesis itself. You convert philosophy into testable waypoints.

This avoids endless debates about metaphysics by pricing the world the thesis implies.

⸻

7) How this integrates with your DCM + EPC (minimal changes)
	•	Keep your two pools per claim (Heretic/Orthodox) and share accounting.
	•	Replace point‑delta with IG (information gain) for minting Claim Shares.
	•	In the Exploration Track, do not pay cash—award Exploration Credits tied to cross‑lens IG (especially RPL↔HEL).
	•	In the Adjudication Track, resolve on episode IG under a declared judge lens (e.g., SEL if you want “user‑evidence‑only truth”), and transfer T_A from losing to winning pool as you already designed.
	•	Keep Resilience Yield from failed challenges exactly as you proposed; it’s a nice way to pay capital for being right without motion.

⸻

8) Why this addresses your worry—from first principles
	•	You get the unconstrained, free‑flow outputs (RPL) explicitly, so you can see the model’s learned consensus before citations sanitize it.
	•	You let non‑academic evidence move beliefs because HEL/SEL give it a lawful path with reliability scores instead of prestige filters.
	•	You don’t confuse novelty with truth because only adjudication episodes—declared in advance with a fixed lens—move money.
	•	You turn “consensus amplification” into a measurable quantity (AG, SC) rather than a vibe.
	•	You reward durable updates via EPC with episode IG, so people don’t get paid for whipsawing a model.

⸻

9) My calibrated priors (subjective but explicit)
	•	Probability this lens‑vector design routinely surfaces surprising model priors that wouldn’t appear under citation constraints: ~0.85.
	•	Probability that admitting non‑academic evidence with the reliability primitives above leads to useful updates (net of gaming): ~0.70.
	•	Probability that paying only on episode IG (not instantaneous deltas) prevents most oscillation exploits: ~0.9.
	•	Probability that, without an Exploration Track, you’d systematically miss valuable heresies because they lack prestige citations: ~0.6–0.7.

These are working credences, not gospel. They’re high because they align with known behavior of LLMs (distributional priors, RLHF bias toward “safe middle,” retrieval inertia) and with incentive‑compatible scoring rules.

⸻

10) Where to push next (conceptually)
	•	Define admissibility once, prestige‑blind: what makes evidence good is its provenance, reproducibility, and attack‑resistance, not its venue.
	•	Publish the belief vectors and the AG/SI/SC metrics on every claim card. The transparency itself is a public good.
	•	Make every challenger declare one discriminating prediction their argument implies within a finite horizon. You’re buying skin in the future.

There’s real intellectual oxygen in letting the model speak twice: once as a creature of its training (RPL), and once as a constrained evaluator. The gap between those two is where heresy earns its keep.
