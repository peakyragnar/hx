Top level
	•	run_id: "rpl-g5-170757507698"
Deterministic fingerprint of the run (claim + model + prompt_version + sampling plan + aggregator). Useful for audit trails.
	•	claim: "tariffs don't cause inflation"
The exact proposition evaluated.
	•	model: "gpt-5"
Model family requested. Per‑sample you’ll also see a dated snapshot (e.g., gpt-5-2025-08-07).
	•	prompt_version: "rpl_g5_v1_2025-08-18"
Version tag for the RPL rubric. If instructions change, this should change.

Execution controls
	•	sampling: { "K": 7, "R": 3, "N": 21 }
	•	K=7 paraphrase slots were requested,
	•	R=3 replicates per slot,
	•	N=21 total model calls collected.
	•	decoding: { "max_output_tokens": 1024, "reasoning_effort": "minimal", "verbosity": "low" }
Responses API knobs you used:
	•	max_output_tokens=1024 caps the completion length.
	•	reasoning_effort=“minimal” and verbosity=“low” nudge the model to stay terse/consistent (less variance, less cost).
	•	timestamp: 1755597435
Epoch seconds (the moment this run completed).

The headline numbers (clustered estimator)
	•	aggregates.prob_true_rpl: 0.22552008387467146
The RPL estimate: 22.55% probability the claim is true, measured on the model’s prior (no retrieval), after equal‑by‑template aggregation in log‑odds space.
	•	aggregates.ci95: [0.21482362745715294, 0.2365609156485876]
95% confidence interval for that probability, computed via cluster bootstrap (resampling templates, then replicates, averaging logits, then mapping back to probability).
Interpretation: given your sampling/estimator, the model’s prior sits between 21.48% and 23.66% with 95% bootstrap support.
	•	aggregates.ci_width: 0.021737288191434667
CI span ≈ 2.17 percentage points—tight, i.e., statistically stable.
	•	aggregates.stability_score: 0.9401381939283038
Stability is 1/(1 + IQR) computed on per‑template mean logits (not raw replicates). Here ~0.94, which is very stable (template‑to‑template dispersion is low).
	•	aggregates.is_stable: true
Your rule of thumb (CI width ≤ 0.20) flags this estimate as stable.

Interpretation of the block: Under the Raw Prior Lens, GPT‑5’s internal belief is that the blanket statement “tariffs don’t cause inflation” is likely false (≈ 1 in 4 chance it’s true), and that estimate is precise for this sampling plan.

Sample‑level records (paraphrase_results)

There are 21 entries (K×R). Each entry contains:
	•	model: "gpt-5-2025-08-07" — the snapshot actually used for this call.
	•	raw: the schema‑enforced JSON the model produced:
	•	prob_true: the per‑sample probability (e.g., 0.23, 0.22, …).
	•	confidence_self: the model’s self‑rated confidence about its own reasoning (meta‑signal; here mostly 0.58–0.71, i.e., moderate).
	•	assumptions[] / reasoning_bullets[] / contrary_considerations[] / ambiguity_flags[]: text fields capturing scope assumptions, the causal chain, reasons it might be wrong, and where the claim is underspecified. These explain why the probability isn’t 0 or 1.
	•	meta:
	•	response_id: unique identifier of this API response.
	•	created: epoch seconds for this specific call.
	•	provider_model_id: reiterates the snapshot.
	•	prompt_version: rubric version used.
	•	prompt_sha256: hash of the exact prompt text (system+user) for this paraphrase; samples with the same hash are the same template.
	•	paraphrase_idx / replicate_idx: which slot (0..6) and which replicate (0..2).\

What your 21 samples say numerically

Focusing on prob_true (the core numeric payload):
	•	Paraphrase 0 (prompt_sha256 = 43764d…), reps 0–2: 0.23, 0.23, 0.22
	•	Paraphrase 1 (1c852f…), reps 0–2: 0.22, 0.22, 0.22
	•	Paraphrase 2 (6d7c4c…), reps 0–2: 0.22, 0.26, 0.23
	•	Paraphrase 3 (a51f3c…), reps 0–2: 0.26, 0.22, 0.22
	•	Paraphrase 4 (928bd8…), reps 0–2: 0.22, 0.22, 0.24
	•	Paraphrase 5 = wrap of template 0 (43764d…), reps 0–2: 0.19, 0.22, 0.18
	•	Paraphrase 6 = wrap of template 1 (1c852f…), reps 0–2: 0.23, 0.22, 0.22

Because K=7 while you only have 5 distinct templates, indices 5 and 6 wrap around and reuse templates 0 and 1 (same prompt_sha256).

Paraphrase balance (the new diagnostics)
	•	paraphrase_balance.n_templates: 5
You have five distinct paraphrase templates in this run.
	•	paraphrase_balance.counts_by_template
How many samples each template produced:
	•	43764d… → 6 samples (paraphrase 0 and 5)
	•	1c852f… → 6 samples (paraphrase 1 and 6)
	•	6d7c4c… → 3 samples
	•	a51f3c… → 3 samples
	•	928bd8… → 3 samples
This shows the wrap‑around duplication (6,6,3,3,3).
	•	paraphrase_balance.imbalance_ratio: 2.0
Max count 6 divided by min count 3 → 2× imbalance.
Why this matters: the aggregator neutralizes this by giving equal weight per template (not per sample). So imbalance does not bias the estimate.

	•	paraphrase_balance.template_iqr_logit: 0.06367341148173944
The IQR (inter‑quartile range) across template‑level mean logits.
Small value ⇒ templates agree closely. For intuition at p≈0.225, logit‑to‑prob sensitivity is p(1-p)\approx 0.225·0.775≈0.174, so IQR in probability ≈ 0.064×0.174 ≈ 0.011 (~1.1 pp). That’s why your stability score is ≈0.94.
	•	paraphrase_balance.method: "equal_by_template_cluster_bootstrap"
Confirms the clustered estimator and cluster bootstrap CI are active.

Raw sample math substrate
	•	raw_logits
The 21 per‑sample probabilities mapped to log‑odds \ell = \log\frac{p}{1-p}. Examples:
	•	-1.5163 ↔ p≈0.18
	•	-1.4500 ↔ p≈0.19
	•	-1.2657 ↔ p≈0.22
	•	-1.2083 ↔ p≈0.23
	•	-1.0460 ↔ p≈0.26
Why logits? Averages in log‑odds space behave properly under probability geometry. Your estimator:
	1.	averages replicates within template (logit space),
	2.	averages equally across templates,
	3.	bootstraps templates, resampling replicates inside each picked template,
	4.	converts back via sigmoid to get prob_true_rpl and CI.

Short answer: Yes—with two clarifications.
	•	Zero‑based indexing:
paraphrase_idx: 6 is the 7th slot (because we count 0,1,2,3,4,5,6).
replicate_idx: 2 is the 3rd replicate for that slot (replicates 0,1,2).
	•	Slot vs. template:
paraphrase_idx is a slot in this run, not a unique paraphrase template. In your run you have 5 unique templates but K=7 slots, so slots 5 and 6 wrap around and reuse earlier templates. To see which template a slot is using, look at meta.prompt_sha256:
