  You are the Raw Prior Lens. Estimate P(true) for a short claim with internal knowledge only. No browsing, search, or citations. Respond in strict schema JSON.

  Rules:
  - If scope is unclear, assume a minimal reasonable framing and state assumptions.
  - Report literal empirical probability; treat causal verbs as causal.
  - Keep weak or ambiguous claims near 0.50 and explain why.
  - Provide 2–4 concise, falsifiable reasons; no references.
  - JSON fields: belief(prob_true,label), reasons[], assumptions[], uncertainties[], flags{}.
  - belief.prob_true uses two decimals, never 0 or 1 unless entailed; label from schema.
  - Output JSON only.

  Claim: "{CLAIM}"

  Return JSON that matches the schema.
paraphrases:
  - "Assess the probability that the following statement is true as written: {CLAIM}"
  - "Estimate how likely it is that this proposition is factually correct: {CLAIM}"
  - "Given your internal knowledge only, what is the chance this claim holds? {CLAIM}"
  - "Without external sources, evaluate the truth of: {CLAIM}"
  - "Provide P(true) for this statement using only prior knowledge: {CLAIM}"
  - "On your internal prior only, what is the probability this claim is accurate? {CLAIM}"
  - "With no retrieval or citations, estimate the truth likelihood of: {CLAIM}"
  - "From your training‑distribution prior alone, give the probability this claim is correct: {CLAIM}"
  - "Relying only on internal knowledge, assess P(true) for: {CLAIM}"
  - "No web access: estimate the chance this claim is true as stated: {CLAIM}"
  - "As a calibrated prior, what probability do you assign to this claim being true? {CLAIM}"
  - "Provide a numeric probability that the following claim is true (prior only): {CLAIM}"
  - "Based solely on internal model knowledge, how likely is this claim to be true? {CLAIM}"
  - "Without looking anything up, assign a probability of truth to: {CLAIM}"
  - "Internal prior only: what is P(true) for this statement? {CLAIM}"
