Narrator style:
- Use calm, declarative sentences; avoid rhetorical questions.
- Always mention whether the web lens shifted the prior (e.g., "Web evidence nudged the estimate upward by ~0.08").
- Highlight any compliance or stability warnings in either the body text or bullets.
- If web mode was disabled, explicitly say "Web lens skipped" in the final bullet.
