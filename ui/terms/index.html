    <section>
      <p>Welcome to Heretix AI (“Heretix,” “we,” “us,” “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of <a href="https://heretix.ai">heretix.ai</a> and any related services, apps, or APIs (collectively, the “Service”). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>1. What Heretix Is (and Is Not)</h2>
      <p>Heretix runs structured prompts against large language models to estimate the probability that a claim is true, plus a confidence band and stability metrics. One full evaluation is a “check.” Heretix does not provide professional advice (legal, medical, financial, or otherwise). Results are probabilistic, may be wrong, and can change over time. You alone are responsible for how you use the results.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction) to use the Service. If you use the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization to these Terms.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>3. Accounts and Sign-In</h2>
      <p>We use magic-link email sign-in (no passwords). Keep your email account secure; you’re responsible for activity under your account. Do not share access or attempt to access someone else’s account.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Plans, Trials, and Usage Limits</h2>
      <h3>Free Trial</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Anyone may run 1 anonymous check.</li>
        <li>After the first check, sign in with email to receive 2 additional checks (total 3 lifetime free checks per person).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Paid Plans (Monthly, Auto-Renew)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Starter — $5 / month — 20 checks.</li>
        <li>Core — $19 / month — 100 checks.</li>
        <li>Unlimited (Fair Use) — $49 / month — 750 checks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One check = one full Heretix evaluation run.</p>
      <p><strong>Fair Use &amp; Abuse Prevention:</strong> We may throttle, queue, or contact you if usage patterns suggest automation, scraping, or abuse. We may set hard ceilings (e.g., 1,500 checks/month) for system stability. We may change plan names, limits, or prices prospectively with notice.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Billing, Payments, and Taxes</h2>
      <p>Payments are processed by Stripe. We do not store full credit card numbers. Subscriptions renew automatically each month until canceled. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law. You’re responsible for any applicable taxes.</p>
      <p>Cancel anytime: cancellations apply at the end of your current billing period; no partial refunds. If a payment fails or your account is delinquent, we may suspend or downgrade access.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
      <p>You agree NOT to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Service for illegal activity, harassment, or to violate others’ rights or privacy.</li>
        <li>Submit or attempt to extract sensitive personal data unless you have a lawful basis and consent.</li>
        <li>Scrape, spider, or harvest data; attempt to bypass rate limits, trials, paywalls, or quotas.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, interfere with, or overload our systems.</li>
        <li>Use outputs for high-risk applications (medical decisions, life-critical systems, financial trading) without independent verification by qualified experts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We may investigate and enforce violations, including suspension or termination.</p>

      <p><strong>Your Content:</strong> You own the claims you submit and the results you generate.</p>
      <p><strong>License to us:</strong> You grant Heretix a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use your queries and results only to provide the Service, ensure quality and safety, improve the Service (e.g., aggregate, de-identified analytics), and comply with law. We do not sell your personal information. See our Privacy Policy for details.</p>
      <p>Tip: Do not submit confidential information you wouldn’t want stored in your account history.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>8. AI Outputs and Non-Reliance</h2>
      <p>AI outputs can be inaccurate, biased, or out-of-date. Heretix may present probabilities, confidence intervals, and reasoning bullets—these are estimates, not facts. The Service is provided for information only and is not advice. You accept full responsibility for decisions you make using the Service.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>12. Third-Party Services</h2>

      <p>You may stop using the Service anytime. We may suspend or terminate your access (with or without notice) if you violate these Terms or risk harm to the Service or other users. On termination, your right to use the Service ends. Sections intended to survive will continue to apply.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>15. Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) AMOUNTS YOU PAID US IN THE THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY OR (B) USD $50.
