      <p>Website: <a href="https://heretix.ai">https://heretix.ai</a></p>

    <section>
      <h2>What We Collect</h2>
      <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Email address:</strong> Used for account creation/sign-in (e.g., magic links), receipts, and important service notices.</li>
        <li><strong>Queries &amp; results:</strong> The claims you submit and the outputs we compute (probabilities, confidence intervals, stability metrics, reasoning bullets). These are tied to your account so you can review your history.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Payment Information</h3>
      <p>Handled by Stripe. When you subscribe, your payment details are collected and processed by Stripe. We do not receive or store full credit card numbers. Stripe may share limited billing information (such as the last four digits or payment status) so we can manage your subscription. See Stripe’s privacy notice for more details.</p>
      <h3>Minimal Technical Data</h3>
      <p>We may process IP address, user agent, device/browser information, and timestamps in server logs, fraud checks, and rate-limiting systems. These are used to secure the service (abuse prevention, diagnostics) and are not sold.</p>
      <h3>Optional Analytics</h3>
      <p>If we enable privacy-respecting analytics in the future, we will disclose the provider here and update this policy. We do not run cross-site targeted advertising.</p>

        <li>Customer support: respond to requests, fix issues, and notify you of important changes.</li>

    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
      <p>We share information with processors/service providers working on our behalf under contract, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stripe (payments and subscription management).</li>
        <li>Email provider (to send magic links and service emails).</li>

      </ul>

    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>International Transfers</h2>
      <p>We may process data in the United States and other countries where our providers operate. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) for cross-border transfers.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Email, queries, and results: kept while you maintain an account so you can revisit your history. If you delete your account or ask us to, we will delete or anonymize this data unless we must retain certain records for legal, accounting, or fraud-prevention reasons.</li>
        <li>Technical logs: retained for a limited time for security and diagnostics (typically 30–90 days), then deleted or aggregated.</li>
        <li>Backups: may persist for a bounded period before rolling off.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can request deletion at any time (see “Your rights &amp; choices”).</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information (encrypted transport, restricted access, least-privilege credentials, periodic reviews). No system is perfectly secure; we encourage you to use a strong, unique email account and keep your devices safe.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
      <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Access the data we hold about you.</li>
        <li>Correct inaccurate data.</li>
        <li>Delete your data (subject to legal retention).</li>
        <li>Export your data (portability).</li>
        <li>Object to or restrict certain processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:team@heretix.ai">team@heretix.ai</a> and we will respond as required by law. If you are in the EEA/UK, you also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.</p>
      <h3>Email and Product Updates</h3>
      <p>We may send transactional emails (sign-in links, receipts). You can opt out of non-essential updates at any time via the email footer or by contacting us.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>Heretix is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will delete it.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
      <p>We use strictly necessary cookies (or equivalent storage) for sessions and security (for example, magic-link sign-in, CSRF protection, plan gating). If we later introduce analytics cookies, we will update this policy and, where required, request consent.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>AI Model Providers</h2>
      <p>When you submit a claim, the text of your query is processed by our vetted AI model provider(s) to generate a result. We store the result so you can view it later and so we can evaluate quality and safety. We instruct providers to process data solely to deliver the service to us and not to use it for their own advertising. For details on their data practices, see the provider’s privacy documentation.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>Do Not Track / “Sale” and “Sharing” (California)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
        <li>We do not “share” your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.</li>
        <li>We do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals at this time.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If we materially change these practices, we will update this policy and, where required, provide choice.</p>
    </section>

    <div class="section-break"></div>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes. We will post the updated date at the top and, if changes are material, provide additional notice (for example, email or in-app).</p>
